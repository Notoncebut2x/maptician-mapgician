Max, Safy and I successfully harvested a bushel of hops from Rancho CucaMaxThienVinho (part of Audrey's Deanwood Darling Farms) and used the hops, along with some store bought ones to make a fall ready NEIPA.
<br>
<br>
We bought hops rhizomes from Adventure in homebrewing, specifically, [Nugget](https://www.homebrewing.org/Nugget-Hop-Rhizomes_p_639.html) and [Williamete](https://www.homebrewing.org/Willamette-Hop-Rhizomes_p_644.html).  Our first year crop was pretty small and do to scheduleding we did not harvest a single hop flower.  However, this year the crop was much larger and we had enough to attempt a brew with.
<br>
<br>
Hopefully next year, we will be able to havest enough to exlusively use the homegrown stuff and not have to augment it with any store bought peletes.

Update: After two weeks of bottling the beer tastes great...perhaps even my best but there hasn't been any carbination...what did we do wrong?
