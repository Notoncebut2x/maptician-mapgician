This site is a way for me to organize my notes and thoughts on various projects I work on.  It is written in manner that may seem intended for an external audiences, but this is really just a trick I play on myself to put pressure on writing clear instructions and notes to myself (thanks  for the inspiration for this).

With that said, if you do happen to stumble across this site, please don't let that stop you from reaching out if you do have any questions, comments or suggestions.
