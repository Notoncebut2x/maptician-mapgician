The last brew of 2016 will be a Kölsch and is my first attempt at lagering.  It should be done in six weeks, just in tiem for groundhog day.

On December 17th, 2016 I brewed with [Safy](https://twitter.com/_cloudbuster){:target="_blank"} in [Max's](https://twitter.com/richmanmax?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor){:target="_blank"} backyard in Deanwood, Washington DC.  We loosely followed DC's own, the mad fermentationist's [fall kolsch](http://www.themadfermentationist.com/2010/09/fall-kolsch-recipe.html){:target="_blank"} recipe and  purchased our ingredients from [3 Star Brewing Co.'s](http://3starsbrewing.com/){:target="_blank"} Homebrew Supply store.

EOTR or "East of the River" comes from a hashtag popular with DC resident living on the eastern bank of the Anacostia River.  A bit of wishful thinking with the other brewers and I but we are assuming this is the first post-prohibition Kölsch brewed in the EOTR.  Recipe is as follows:
