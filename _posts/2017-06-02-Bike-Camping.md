  feature: Bike Camping on the C&O and W&OD Trails
---

The most expensive purchased I have made in my life (measured in dollars, time, pain, joy, and sweat) is my [Bianchi Lupo Bicylce](http://www.bianchiusa.com/bikes/road/all-road/lupo/){:target="_blank"}. It has brought me to work, and I have taken her out on joy rides ( SF 2 Cupertino, Fall Foliage Ride in the Appalachians, DC 2 Baltimore, etc... ) but I had yet to load her with gear and camp overnight.

Enter bike guru and friend of the site [Max Jay Richman](http://richmanmax.com/){:target="_blank"}, who proposed a late spring route up the C&O Canal and back on the W&OD trail.

Day One started at the Canal Trail's entrance in Georgetown with a 33 mile bike ride to [Turtle Run Campsite](https://www.canaltrust.org/pyv/turtle-run-campsite/){:target="_blank"}, a free biker/hiker campsite maintained by the C&O trust.  See the ride on strava!

Day Two had us crossing the mighty Potomac at [White's Ferry](http://www.poolesvillemd.gov/338/Whites-Ferry){:target="_blank"}

From there we picked up the Washington & Old Dominion trail in Leesburg.  We made a couple of de-tours to local breweries Old Ox and Lost Rhino, as well as an amazing North Carolinia BBQ joint but were able to make it to the Reston Wiehle metro station hop on and make it to DC in time to watch the second half of the Champions League final...Hala Madrid!

You can see the day two route in strava as well!
