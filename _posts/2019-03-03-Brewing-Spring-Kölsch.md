Having missed out on the [DC Homebrewers Club Cherry Blossom Competition](http://www.dchbcompetition.com/) for the last three year, Safy and I decided to do a brew at around the last minute possible.  On Safy's suggestion we went with a Spring Kölsch and found inspiration from two sources: [Trillium Brewing](https://www.trilliumbrewing.com/trillium-sprang-kolsch-inspired-ale/), and the Mad Fermenationsit's [Fall Kolsch](https://www.themadfermentationist.com/2010/09/fall-kolsch-recipe.html) (which we have made before).
