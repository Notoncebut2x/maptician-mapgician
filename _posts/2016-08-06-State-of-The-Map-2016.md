Tom Gertin of the DOS/HIU and I spoke at State of the Map US 2016.  It was my
first time presenting at a conference related to my work...the only other time I
spoke was at a conference related to the statistical method I used in my Master's
thesis.  If you are interested, you can watch the video above or checkout [the
slides here](https://notoncebut2x.github.io/realityIsVirtual/#/){:target="_blank"}.

We spoke about our respective office's use of the Virtual Foreign Service
Internship program.  The program allows students attending college, be it
undergraduate or graduate school to work 8 - 12 hours a week in support of a
Federal Deparment or Agency.  In our case, we had eleven students mapping in
OpenStreetMap to add data in the locations where our offices are working.

Our interns did a great job contributing 460 Changesets for 19,246 individual
changes (big shout out to [Thad Kerosky](https://twitter.com/thadk){:target="_blank"} for helping
pull those stats!).  

It was a fun experience, good practice speaking in front of an audience  and I
learned a lot.  Hopefully I will be working on something interesting enough to
be able to speak at events once a year.
