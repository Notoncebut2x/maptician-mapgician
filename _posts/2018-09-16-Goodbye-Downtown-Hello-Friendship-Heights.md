I recently changed the place I travel to on weekday mornings and spend around 8 hours at.  The new gig is at a USAID implementing partner, [Creative Associates](https://www.creativeassociatesinternational.com/).  Moving from USAID to one of their implementing partners is pretty common in the industry and allows me to build on my experience in the geospatial + interntional development realm.  

I made the jump to the "dark side" for three main reason.  First, I get to work on a broader range of development issues as Creative has three practice areas they focus on: Communities In Transition, Economic Grouth, and Education.  Secondly, I am more involved in the design of programs, something I did not have the opportunity to do at my previous job.  Getting involved early to influence how data is collected, processed, and visualized by a program is something I have been pinning to do for a while.  I could honestly write an entire post on this but I think having experience in both tech and development will allow me to make sure I do not just bring in hyped up tools or get programs to spend exessive amounts on priopiatary platforms.  Finally, I get to work on building bigger tools to help projects.  There are still one off cartographic products to work on but I am also working with my boss on projects that will be used across programs and go deeper then mapping a single theme.

Further the new office is near [Rodman's](http://rodmans.com/) Grocery!
