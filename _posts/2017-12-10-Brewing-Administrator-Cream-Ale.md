Around this time of year, as tradition dictates,  [Safy](https://twitter.com/_cloudbuster){:target="_blank"} and myself brew a beer for our work's holiday party in order to give it as a gift to USAID's Administrator.  

This year we chose to brew a Cream Ale since not only would it be a good pun on his name, Mark Green, but also as an ode to his home state of [Wisconsin](http://www.wmmb.com/){:target="_blank"} where dairy is a major industry and a [Cream Ale](https://newglarusbrewing.com/beers/OurBeers/Beer/spotted-cow){:target="_blank"} is a popular beer.

We loosely based the recipe off of the Mad Fermentationist's [Aroumatic Cream Ale Recipe](){:target="_blank"}.  We did however go in a very different direction with our hops.
