The first beer [Safy](https://twitter.com/_cloudbuster){:target="_blank"} and I are brewing for 2017 is a Kirsche Tee [Roggenbier](https://www.craftbeer.com/craft-beer-muses/roggenbier-return-rye){:target="_blank"} for the DC Homebrewers Club [Cherry Blossom Competition](http://www.dchbcompetition.com/){:target="_blank"}.  Last year we attempted to brew our first sour beer with a gose infused with [sakura tea](https://www.amazon.com/Pickled-Sakura-Cherry-Blossoms-1-06oz/dp/B00A3ANO0U/ref=pd_sim_325_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00A3ANO0U&pd_rd_r=QBSACAXJ7317JV2CE21K&pd_rd_w=Ix4hA&pd_rd_wg=HSNWr&psc=1&refRID=QBSACAXJ7317JV2CE21K){:target="_blank"}.  The results were rather cheesy and after months of adding brett to try and rescue it (thats another story), we decided not submitting it.  

This year we wanted to stick with doing a sakura tea infusion but wanted to do so with a different brew.  Further, doing research, Safy found that [El Dorado Hops](http://www.hopslist.com/hops/aroma-hops/el-dorado/) were described as having a cherry or other stone fruit aroma ...a perfect hops for our cherry tea beer.  We decided to create our own recipe and wanting our beer to have a redish tinge to it, we decided to go with a rye based malt mixed with wheat (hopefully to give it a more pinkish color).

Lucky for us Roggenbeir, a german beer brewed with Rye, fit our needs perfectly and using that as our starting point we came up with our  _Kirsche Tee Roggenbier_.
